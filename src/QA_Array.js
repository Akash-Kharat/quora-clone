      "question": "What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?",
      "answer": "HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, while HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. The main difference between the two is that HTTPS uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure the connection between the client and server, while HTTP does not."

      "question": "What is the difference between a stack and a queue?",
      "answer": "A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, while a queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle."

    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?",
      "answer": "A compiler translates source code into machine code before execution, while an interpreter executes source code directly without translating it into machine code."

    {
        "question": "What is the difference between a linked list and an array?",
        "answer": "An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations, while a linked list is a collection of elements called nodes, each containing a reference to the next node in the sequence."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree?",
        "answer": "A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, while a binary search tree is a binary tree in which the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key."

      {
        "question": "What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?",
        "answer": "An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, while an interface can only have abstract methods. A class can implement multiple interfaces, but can only inherit from one abstract class."
